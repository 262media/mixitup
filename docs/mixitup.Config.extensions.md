# mixitup.Config.extensions

## Overview

An group of references to any mixitup extensions to be applied to the
instance. This is only neccessary when loading mixitup via a module
loader such as Browserify or RequireJS, where a reference to the
extension cannot be acessed from the global `window` scope.
