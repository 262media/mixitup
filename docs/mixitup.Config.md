# mixitup.Config

## Overview

`mixitup.Config` is an interface implemented by MixItUp as a means of customising
the functionality of your mixitup instance. It is organised into several semantically
distinct sub-objects, each one dealing with a particular aspect of MixItUp functionality.

An object literal containing any or all of the available properies,
known as the "configuration object", can be passed as the second parameter to
the `mixitup` factory function when creating a mixer instance to customise its
functionality as needed.

If no congiguration object is passed, the mixer instance will take on the default
configuration values detailed below.
